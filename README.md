The Information Age Journal of Physics

Scientific knowledge and progress in the age of the internet is severely hampered
by the existing journal model.

It costs thousands of dollars to read journal articles, even though the authors and reviewers
do most the work and they do it for free.  It's been called a racket and worse.

Further, the rich user experience available to people through the web browser today is 
incredibly beneficial in the way of visualizing, animating, and creating interactive, parameterizable
demonstrations. Instead of taking advantage of that, the journals insist on printable static documents.

Therefore, I propose git as the new platform for publishing and reviewing scientific articles.

This git repo is a physics journal.

A top level folder will be created for each new year, and a subfolder for each month.

If you would like to publish in the journal, submit a pull request with your article as a 
new subfolder in the current month of the current year.

All review takes place in GitHub issues.
